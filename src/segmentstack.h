  Segment Stack:
  - the segment stack has a low and a high segment
  - the trailer (the last slot) of each segment is kept
  - on push, both segments are filled from low to high
    - if both segments are full, the low segment is dropped and a new segment is
  placed above of the high segment
  - on pop, values are taken from high and then low segment
    - if the segments are empty and there are trailers left, a restoration
  request is issued
    - if the segments are empty and the trailers are empty, there is no more
  data in the stack
