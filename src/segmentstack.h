/*
  auxiliary stack, used by the EHKDFS
  - the segment stack has a low and a high segment
  - the trailer (the last slot) of each segment is kept
  - on push, both segments are filled from low to high
    - if both segments are full, the low segment is dropped and a new segment is
  placed above of the high segment
  - on pop, values are taken from high and then low segment
    - if the segments are empty and there are trailers left, a restoration
  request is issued
    - if the segments are empty and the trailers are empty, there is no more
  data in the stack
  - instead of using a list of trailers, there is the option to store only the
  last trailer in a variable (used in EHKDFS)

  The segment size can be computed using the ε parameter:
  2q entries on the segment stack shall take up at most (ε/3)n bits, thus each
  segment has a size of ((ε/6)n)/bitsize(ENTRY) bits, where bitsize(x) is the
  number of bits a type occupies (e.g. bitsize(uint)=32).
